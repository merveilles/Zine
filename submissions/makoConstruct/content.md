# Newcomb's Heedless Doe

The Prudent Tribe lives alongside the streams that flow from the mountains. They are defended from invasion by their cousins, the Quick Tribe, who live down in the forest.

Both tribes tell this story:

>Father Quick meets a doe in the forest that is heedless to his presence. It sees him as he approaches, but it goes on munching leaves as if there's no danger. Father quickly spears it. We eat well.

>Mother Prudent also meets a heedless doe in the forest. She has her bow, but she will not kill it. She says that this calmness it exhibits in front of a human hunter is virtuous, and she says that it must not be punished for it.

Each tribe believes that its ancestor was the hero of the story, and that the others' ancestor was the fool. Within Quick culture, anyone who lacks the essential personal quality of Quick opportunism cannot be called an adult. Likewise, within Prudent culture, all are expected to exhibit Prudent fairness.

Leto Prudent and Haile Quick want desperately to marry.

In the intersection of their two cultures they have found a synthesis greater than either. They have become members of both, and neither. Haile makes Leto sing out with joy.

On the question of The Heedless doe, the two ultimately agree with Mother Prudent, preferring not to punish trust, but either one would kill any number of heedless does if it would allow them to stay together.

Leto has finally worked up the resolve to ask Haile's father to endorse the marriage. It feels like the perfect moment, but when the father understands what is being asked, all levity falls from his face. He says, soberly, "You are a good Prudent, but you  know that I won't advocate for this marriage between our tribes unless I can convince myself that you have developed the heart of a Quick adult."

It hurts to hear, but Leto understands. Haile's father truly believes that if Prudent principles spread into the forest, the warrior culture of the Quick would soften and both tribes would be overcome by invaders. It isn't true. Leto had seen, through Haile, that the Quicks' warrior sensitivity does not soften easily even when it wishes to, more than this, Haile says that the Quick would be greatly strengthened by integrating more closely with Prudent crafters. The Quick need more ergonomic weapons and they need to be shown how to maintain the existing supply. Haile's father cannot be convinced of this. For now and maybe forever, Leto will have to attend his concerns.

Leto goes to speak, but Haile's father interrupts, "No. I've heard all that you could say. Now you're desperate, you're going to start saying things you don't truly believe. I wont let you dig a hole for yourself. Go out into the forest there. Come back only when you see that the light of this fire has faded. I will have made my decision by then. You will return either to find Haile standing here, ready to stay with you, or you'll find that Haile has left with us. I can't yet say which."

And so, under the moonlight, Leto wanders alone.

Leto realizes that the fire at the camp has burned out by now, and so the decision has been made. Either Haile is waiting or Haile is gone, and that is that and nothing can be done to change it. The Prudent have a saying, "confronting truth can never hurt you." Even knowing this, Leto does not yet feel ready to return and confront the truth.


Then, there, Leto sees the heedless doe, it gazes at the tip of Leto's spear as if it sees no danger, calm as a child watching its mother weave.

If Haile's father could see this scene now, everything would hinge on what Leto decides to do.

Haile's father cannot see Leto now.

Even if Haile's father's decision is still open to change, no deer carcass can prove that this miraculous thing has happened; the body of a heedless doe and the body of a frightful doe look the same.

Leto knows that Haile's father is a shrewd judge of character. The man has lived many lives. Often, he would look into a youth's eyes and predict their future with certainty.Â 

Yet, there is no causal arrow pointing from the death of the heedless doe to Haile's father's decision, how could it matter what Leto does?


Eventually, something seems to spook the doe, and it disappears into the shadows of the forest.

Leto returns to find that all of the Quick have left the camp. Haile is gone.

Was sparing the doe the right choice?

Look over the possible outcomes

| Choice | Predicted choice | Outcome                               | Ranking      |
|:------:|:----------------:|---------------------------------------|:------------:|
| kill   | spare            | The doe dies, Haile is gone           | worst        |
| spare  | spare            | The doe lives, Haile is gone          |              |
| kill   | kill             | The doe dies, The tribes are married  |              |
| spare  | kill             | The doe lives, The tribes are married | best         |

Seeing them, you might decide that once the judge's prediction has been cast, sparing the doe will always get you a slightly better outcome. It would, if the predicted choice were already written somewhere you could see it, but it isn't, is it? You don't know what the predicted choice was. However, you know that Haile's father is a very good judge of character; you know that it is likely that the prediction will be the same as whatever you really do.

If you accept this, you're left with a choice of only two worlds. (spare, spare) and (kill, kill)

You had better hope that you do the right thing.

There, Leto sees the heedless doe, it gazes at the tip of Leto's spear as if it sees no danger, calm as a child watching its mother weave.

Haile's father cannot see Leto now, but he knew what Leto would do, even if Leto doesn't yet.

It's like it's predetermined. But predetermination doesn't preclude choice. It accounts for choice. It lets choice happen and ensues in agreement with choice's outputs.

We know that the prediction will align with the choice. The choice is up to us, so, in a way so is the prediction.

Not by causation. Killing the doe wont cause Haile's father to approve.

Not all forms of determination are causal.

Leto imagines that a promise was made between the harried keeper of the gate and the stranger, begging to be trusted with passage. Leto consummates the promise.



Haile smiles broadly as Leto returns to the camp bearing a doe.
